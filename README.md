# Study Logger v2

This is a study logger made by me, which is just a pretty way to plan and see your progress. This was a recompilation of my skills, and how finished I can make a app, along with the UI in under 24 hours. However the previous version used too much maths, which was mostly usesless like telling you which subjects you found difficult and all, which can easily be thought of after looking at your accuracy, frequency and average time, but it used a lot of assumptions, using average times you input to tell it to you etc.

This version is much less complicated and is just a clone of the previous one, with a more aesthetically pleasing, customizeable way to deal with things in the `Spreadsheet` menu. A simple guide on how to get started can be found below. Here I show you what it looks like.

The 0 Days, 1 Times shows days since last done, and number of times you have practiced

You can input any name of any topic, and group it into a particular subject. If you want to add some subjects, other than PCM, you will have to do some work, but if you know programming, just open your_name_d.json and add the subject, and as you encounter errors, fix them :) but I would recommend against adding any subjects

Automatically groups the inputs if there are enough of them, and there is this aesthetic thing here.

Lastly the most lonely of all of these is this kiddo. It can be used to mention revision interval, which tells you which topics you haven't revised for a while. This appears in the first image where I set it to 0.
